## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned to use Flexbox and Grid. I also learned to do the color bar so that it's not too rounded from the corners. 

### Continued development

I still need more practice with Flexbox and Grid and to develope my eye to see when it's best to use which one on a project or use both in the same project.
